# Advent of Code 2020
My solutions for Advent of Code 2020. I am using the Julia language this year.
Advent of code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles made by Eric Wastl.
Every day from the 1st to the 25th of december, a programming puzzle is uploaded on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
Advent of code is a perfect way to get into problem solving and programming in general!
